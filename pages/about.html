    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Sans Forgetica</b> uses 'desired-difficulty' to challenge the brain.
      This is theorized to increase the cognitive effort thus improving the retention and recall of information intake.
      Paired with spaced repetition, it can challenge your memorization and improve your flash card sessions.
      It also might just give you a head ache!
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea came to me when I was reading about the <a href="https://sansforgetica.rmit/">Sans Forgetica</a> project.
      Along with another font &mdash; <a href="https://github.com/anewtypeofinterference/Optician-Sans">Optician Sans</a>, inspired
      by optician charts for vision testing, I figured they paired well for a flashcards.

      Flash cards work great with <a href="http://www.flashcardlearner.com/articles/what-is-spaced-repetition/">spaced repetition</a>.
      These decks aren't just all terms and definitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      They contain best practices, useful tips and summaries of technical knowledge that assist with being a better developer/designer.
      But, they don't replace the actual doing and learning process of building and fixing websites.
