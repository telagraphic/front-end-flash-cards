    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      These are my personal flash card decks I've used to increase my recall of various front end topics.
      The idea came to me when I was reading about the <a href="https://sansforgetica.rmit/">Sans Forgetica</a> project.
      The font makes a perfect pairing with flash cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Sans Forgetica</b> uses 'desired-difficulty' to challenge the brain.
      This is theorized to increase the cognitive effort thus improving the retention and recall of information intake.
      Overall, this should make your memory training with flash cards a more challenging experience to make the terms stick around longer.
      It also might just give you a head ache from reading a broken font.

      <a href="https://github.com/anewtypeofinterference/Optician-Sans">Optician Sans</a> is based on optician charts used for vision testing.
      I use it for chaper titles in the decks and it makes a great visual contrast for readability.

    <p>
      Flash cards are a great way to increase retention and recall using <a href="http://www.flashcardlearner.com/articles/what-is-spaced-repetition/">spaced repetition</a>.
      These decks aren't just all terms and definitions.
      They contain best practices, useful tips and summaries of technical knowledge that assist with being a better developer/designer.
      But, they don't replace the actual doing and learning process of building and fixing websites.
      I hope you them useful.
