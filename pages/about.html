    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>
      <b>Sans Forgetica</b> uses 'desired-difficulty' to challenge the brain.
      This is theorized to increase the cognitive effort thus improving the retention and recall of information intake.
      It also might just give you a head ache from reading a broken font.
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea came to me when I was reading about the <a href="https://sansforgetica.rmit/">Sans Forgetica</a> project.
      Along with another font &mdash; <a href="https://github.com/anewtypeofinterference/Optician-Sans">Optician Sans</a>, inspired
      by optician charts for vision testing, I knew I had to do something cool with these fonts.
      Both make a perfect pairing for flash cards and put my typesetting learnings into a useful project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Flash cards work great with <a href="http://www.flashcardlearner.com/articles/what-is-spaced-repetition/">spaced repetition</a>.
      These decks aren't just all terms and definitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      They contain best practices, useful tips and summaries of technical knowledge that assist with being a better developer/designer.
      But, they don't replace the actual doing and learning process of building and fixing websites.
